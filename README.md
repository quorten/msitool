msi-tool README
===============

`msi-tool` is a tool that helps facilitate the process of creating a
Windows Installer (MSI) package for installing a user application.
`msi-tool` was originally created with the intent of assisting in
creating a proof-of-concept Windows Installer package as fast as
possible.  Thus, the automation tool is not as polished as it could
be.  For a complete guided tutorial on how to use `msi-tool` in the
process of creating a Windows Installer, see `howto.md`.
